# TicTacToe Project
## Overview
- This is a simple project following the logic of the popular board game tictactoe, The aim of this project was to impliment the concepts i have learned as i continue to study java. The concepts of classes, objects,
  methods, constructor, inheritance, error handling, interfaces, algorithms and data structures.
- This was test my level of understanding and to see how i could use each of this concepts in a single project.
- Although my implementation of this concepts are not at their full potential yet i was glad with the results i got. Because it showed me my level of improvement as well as the gaps in my knowladge.
- This project helped me gain some insight into the usefuless of algorithms and data structures. althought i have little experience with this two topics i was able to understand and fill in some gaps in my knowladge
  in reguards to the use of algorithms and how i've been using this concepts in the past without realizing.
- This is the second project i have built in java with the knowladge i have gained so far while improving on my fundamentals on programming.
- With this project i tried to practice good programming prinsibles, such as clean code, and avoid hard coding values into the program as they could lead to problems when implementing future changes.
- Overall i learned a lot building this project.


## Project
- Simple Tic Tac Toe game with turn based gameplay.
- The game has two players which are defined as classes, this are subclasses which inherite their behavior from the Player class.
- The game has a player class which as a superClass or baseClass which defines the behavior of a player with the help of methods such as move(),playState(),play().
- The behavior of players are, they can select a piece[x]/[o], take terns playing, select location where they want to place their piece.
- Players can not place a piece in a cell that already has a piece.
- The game ends once a winning condition is found. These conditions are defined in a class called WinLogic.
- The game uses simple loop searching algorithms, three to be exact. vertical loop, horizontal loop, and diagonal loop searches which check for same values in any given direction to determine a win.
- The game makes use of the GridView class to draw the board

## Deficulties
- While working on this project i'll admit to facing more challanges than i had anticipated, such as object handling, error handling, scope definition of elements in the program, unforseen code behavior etc.
- While i was successful in finding the solutions to these problems through reseach, i did however solve most of this problems through lots of trail and error.
- There are a lot more difficulties which i wont mention so as to keep this short and to the point.
- While working on this project i could not look up tutorails or use chatgpt for code samples, which made the time completion of my project longer than expected. Two weeks to be exact.
- I wasn't able to implement every feature i wanted into the project but exeeded the time constriant i gave myself and will have to reveceit the project on a later date.

## Conclution
- This was not a difficult project when i thought of doing it and while i faced challenges working on it for the past days, i am glad i took the initiative to build it because i enjoyed the process a lot. 
- This showed huge gabs in my skills and understanding of programming fundamental, but most importantly this project has shown me how many steps i've taken in getting closer to where i want to be in 
  my carrier as a programmer.
